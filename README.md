# Welcome to the NEON Data Skills Git Repo!

NEON Data Skills gh-pages branch is now deprecated. The NEON Data Skills materials
are now stored and built in the master branch. The rendered tutorial can be found

## About NEON Data Skills 

Education is a key component of the NEON mission. As such this site serves to 
facilitate use of data in both science and education.

NEON Data Skills provides self-paced tutorials, workshops, in depth Data Institutes,
science videos, teaching modules, and teaching data subsets to enhance researchers' 
ability to work with heterogeneous ecological data.
