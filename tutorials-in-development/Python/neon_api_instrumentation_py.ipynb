      "Abstract: Soil temperature is measured at various depths below the soil surface from approximately 2 cm up to 200 cm at non-permafrost sites (up to 300 cm at Alaskan sites). Soil temperature influences the rate of biogeochemical cycling, decomposition, and root and soil biota activity. In addition, soil temperature can impact the hydrologic cycle since it controls whether soil water is in a liquid or solid state. Measurements are made in vertical profiles consisting of up to nine depths in all five instrumented soil plots at each terrestrial site, and presented as 1-minute and 30-minute averages.\r\n",

      "Brief Design Description: When possible the soil plots were arranged in a transect with the first plot approximately 15-40 m from the tower in the expected dominant airshed. The middle of airshed was used as the transect vector and plot spacing was based on the distance required for surface soil temperature and moisture measurements to be spatially independent at the 1 hectare scale during site characterization (capped at approximately 40 m due to logistical constraints). Soil plots were microsited as necessary to avoid obstacles (e.g., boulders, streams, and paths) and more compact plot layouts were used at small sites. Soil temperature is measured at up to nine depths within each plot, with the mid-point of the shallowest sensors at approximately 2, 6, 16, and 26 cm. Depths for deeper sensors vary among sites and are based on megapit soil horizon data (NEON.DP1.00097) and depth to restrictive feature (see NEON.DOC.003146).\r\n",

      "General conventions, used for all data products:\r\n",
      "   NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "   DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "   SITE: a four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code.\r\n",

      "   DPL: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level;\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "   REV: a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product. The REV value is incremented by 1 each time a major change is made in instrumentation, data collection protocol, or data processing such that data from the preceding revision is not directly comparable to the new.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "   HOR: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if five surface measurements were taken, one at each of the five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "   VER: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080.

      "Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and will be on the order of every 3 to 5 years in frequency.\n"
