### Welcome to the NEON Data Skills Portal! 

This site contains data lessons, background materials and other resources that 
support working with large spatio-temporal datasets, like those offered by the 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org" target="_blank">NEON project</a>. 

The NEON Data Skills resources are now fully integrated with  
other NEON project resources on the 
<a href="http://www.NEONScience.org" target="_blank"> www.NEONScience.org </a>
website. All the resources available here are available in the updated
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/opportunities/learning-opportunities/neon-data-skills" target="_blank_"> NEON Data Skills section  </a>. 
The updated structure will allow for increased searchability and integration with
NEON data products.  

We welcome any comments and feedback that you have and also materials that support 
or expand upon what's available on this site!
