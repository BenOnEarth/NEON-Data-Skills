### Welcome to the NEON Data Skills Portal! 

This site contains data lessons, background materials and other resources that 
support working with large spatio-temporal datasets, like those offered by the 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org" target="_blank">NEON project</a>. 

In the near future, the NEON Data Skills website will be fully integrated with  
all NEON project resources. All the resources available here will be 
available at 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/opportunities/learning-opportunities" target="_blank_">NEONScience.org Learning Opportunities</a>. 
The updated structure will allow for increased searchability and integration with
NEON data products.  

We welcome any comments and feedback that you have and also materials that support 
or expand upon what's available on this site!
