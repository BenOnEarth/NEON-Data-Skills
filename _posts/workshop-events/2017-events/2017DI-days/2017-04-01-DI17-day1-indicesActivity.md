## Many Indices

There are many different indices you might want in your research. NEON provides
several indices as data products that have already been calculated and can will
be available for download from the NEON data portal. 

#### NEON Remote Sensing Vegetation Indices, Data Products, and Uncertainty

In this 20 minute video David Hulslander describes NEON Data Products including 
several remote sensing vegetation indices.  This is the same video as assigned 
in the Pre-Institute week 3 materials.

## Activity Steps

1. Choose an index of interest. You may want to check out Verena Henrich & Katharina Br√ºser's 
<a href="http://www.indexdatabase.de/" target="_blank"> Index Database </a> for ideas:
<a href="http://www.indexdatabase.de/" target="_blank"> www.indexdatabase.de/ </a>.  

2. Work with your small group to create a script to calculate this index from 
the NEON data. Be sure to add comments so that the script is useful to others. 

3. Add your script to the GitHub Repo: **DI-NEON-participants** to share with your
colleagues. Save scripts to the DI-NEON-participants/2017-RemoteSensing/rs-indices.  
Be sure to provide a clear file name reflecting the contents. If you are 
comfortable, we recommend you put you names in the script as others may want to 
contact you about it.
