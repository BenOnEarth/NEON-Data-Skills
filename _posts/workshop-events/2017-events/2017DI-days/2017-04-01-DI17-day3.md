## About

Today, we will focus on the importance of uncertainty when using remote sensing
data. 

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">

# Learning Objectives

After completing these activities, you will be able to:

* Measure the differences between a metric derived from remote sensing data and 
the same metric derived from data collected on the ground.

## Schedule: Uncertainty in Remote Sensing

All activities are held in the the Classroom unless otherwise noted.
