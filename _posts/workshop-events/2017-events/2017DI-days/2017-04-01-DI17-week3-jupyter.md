## Welcome to pre-Institute Week 3

In week 3, you will use the Jupyter Notebook file format to document code and efficiently
publish code results & outputs. You will practice your Git skills by publishing
your work in the **NEONScience/DI-NEON-participants** GitHub repository.

Please complete the activity and submit your work to the GitHub repo by
**11:59 Friday June 17th.**

## Week 3 Materials
Please complete each of the short tutorials in this series:

**NOTE:** If you are familiar with using Juyter Notebooks to document your
workflow then you may be able to complete the assignment without viewing the 
tutorials.

Pre-Institute Week 3 Assignment</a> 

Second, on Monday of the Data Institute we will be working with hyperspectral data. Various indices, 
including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), are common data products from hyperspectral
data.  In preparation for this content, please watch this video of David Hulslander discussing NEON 
remote sensing vegetation indices & data products.
