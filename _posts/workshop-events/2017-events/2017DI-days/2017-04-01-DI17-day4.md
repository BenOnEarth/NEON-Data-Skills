On Thursday, we will begin to think about the different types of analysis
that we can do by fusing LiDAR and hyperspectral data products.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">

# Learning Objectives

After completing these activities, you will be able to:

* Classify different spectra from a hyperspectral data product
* Map the crown of trees from hyperspectral & lidar data
* Calculate biomass of vegetation
